# SQL-Unlocked
This repository contains a comprehensive set of SQL projects that demonstrate the use of various SQL concepts such as Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), querying, joins, functions, subqueries, views, stored procedures, and triggers. Each project showcases essential database management techniques, focusing on optimizing performance and ensuring data integrity.
## Project Objectives
The goal of these SQL projects is to:
- **Master SQL fundamentals**: Explore DDL, DML, and querying techniques.
- **Implement relational database design best practices**: Use constraints, views, stored procedures, and triggers to ensure efficient data management.
- **Enhance data analysis**: Use advanced SQL queries to retrieve meaningful insights from datasets.
- **Automate tasks with stored procedures**: Simplify repetitive tasks using procedural SQL.
- **Enforce data integrity**: Implement constraints, triggers, and functions for maintaining accurate and reliable databases.
